/** publish-digest — daily advance-notice surface + digest-state.json.
 *
 *  The digest is the ONLY complete announcement surface: every pass verdict
 *  (ai AND human) must appear in a digest before it can mature — membership
 *  in DigestState.announced, NOT at ≤ lastDigestAt. A verdict pushed to the
 *  branch after a render but carrying an older `at` cannot mature unseen;
 *  it surfaces in the NEXT digest as newly-seen. Missing digest-state →
 *  announced = ∅ → all releases frozen (fail-closed bootstrap).
 *
 *  "Seen" is set-based, not time-based: a verdict counts once its line was
 *  in ai-verdicts.jsonl at render time with at ≤ now. Same-day re-renders
 *  stay cumulative via dayAnnounced, so a second run cannot erase the day's
 *  earlier announcements from the file.
 *
 *  Usage:
 *    tsx pipeline/ai/digest.ts --index index.json --verdicts ai-verdicts.jsonl \
 *      --state digest-state.json --out-dir . [--date YYYY-MM-DD] [--dry] */
