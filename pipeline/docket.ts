/** review-docket — keeps one open [review] issue per pending decision so the
 *  maintainer can rule from a phone: open issue → Labels → tap verdict:pass /
 *  verdict:concern → concern.yml writes the human verdict back.
 *
 *  Targets (four kinds):
 *    - held version whose LATEST verdict is ai-sourced — pass awaiting the
 *      announce+release window, or concern awaiting possible override.
 *      `maturity` (from digest-state.announced) tells the maintainer which
 *      gate the pass is sitting at (D-W)
 *    - 'flag': a LIVE (non-pending) entry whose displayed slot carries
 *      identity-level sec:* redFlags — AI never re-reviews a displayed
 *      version, so the standing issue is the only surface; a human verdict
 *      on the displayed key retires it ONLY if it postdates the flag's
 *      first-observed stamp (flaggedAt) — a verdict older than the signal
 *      decided the bytes, not the repojack (R-14 follow-up)
 *    - 'none' repo-only pendings — AI never reviews version-less entries
 *      (aggregate standing issue: per-entry issues at 500+ scale are
 *      tracker spam)
 *    - 'none' versioned holds that out-aged the diagnose queue — review
 *      backlog or a stalled launchd; surfaced per-issue while small, but
 *      beyond NONE_ISSUE_CAP (or whenever diagnose.paused declares the
 *      local queue stopped) they fold into ONE (unreviewed backlog)
 *      aggregate — a stalled queue must be visible, not a flood
 *
 *  Human verdicts are decisions already → excluded → issue auto-closes.
 *
 *  Usage: tsx pipeline/docket.ts --index index.json --verdicts ai-verdicts.jsonl
